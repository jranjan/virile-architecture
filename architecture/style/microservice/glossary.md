### Bounded Context:

Bounded Context is a central pattern in Domain-Driven Design [DDD] (term coined by Eric Evans in his 2003 book). DDD decomposes
complex software systems into bounded contexts based on natural partitions in the real world problem domain and the unique
perspectives that those contexts embody.
