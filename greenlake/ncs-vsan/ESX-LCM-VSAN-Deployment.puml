"ESX-LCM"->"ESX-LCM": Provision and Configure VSAN Cluster

note over Portal,vCenter
In below discussion, the reference of cluster is for vsan cluster unless
stated specifically. The sequence diagram is based on certain assumptions
as mentioned below.

Host preparation::
1) Disks are presented to host as per storage model.
2) VSAN network is created with all hosts connected to it.
3) Vmkernl adopter is enabled for all hosts.

Cluster configuration::
1) Hybrid cluster is supported only as of now.
2) All nodes are uniform and hence contains same  disk and compute specification.
3) Only default storage policy is created.
end note

"ESX-LCM"->"ESX-LCM": collect_setup_attributes()

note over Portal,vCenter
Cluster setup and configuration needs access of cluster and host API
along with choices asked by user.

The following attributes needs to be collected:
1) username and password
2) certificate
3) license
4) vmware storage model
5) type = {hybrid, flash}

The specific configuration related to following is not covered
as of now:
fault domain support, the enablement of performance services and
multi-cast support if more than one cluster share same subnet
compression and deduplication
end note
