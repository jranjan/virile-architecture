    ...continuation of follow up post-requisite steps after cluster creation.

    The below sequence talks about usage of post requisite steps which needs to be
    perform after cluster creation. For e.g. creation of storage class, installing
    storage driver agents, installing marketplace agents etc.

    Pre-requisite:

         1) ConnectApp has on-boarded and authorized servers
         2) ConnectApp has creatd pseudo zone representing kubernetes cluster.
         3) Kuberentes cluster is created (by K8sLCM)

end note


"K8sLCM" -> "PF9 API": Discovers the kubernets cluster
"K8sLCM" -> "K8sLCM": Deploy marketplace agent

note right of "K8sLCM"
    Goal is to support hostPath as storage option for PoC and HPE 3PAR
    as option for production environment.
end note

opt Storage configuration
   opt Create storage class for hostPath
        "K8sLCM" -> "Kuberentes API": Create storage class to enable dynamic provisioning for hostPath
   end

   opt Enable persistent volume using HPE 3PAR
        "K8sLCM" -> "K8sLCM": Deploy and configure HPE 3PAR FlexVolume driver.

        note right of "K8sLCM"
            Need to deploy dorry FlexVolume driver which in turn runs
            docker container. The configuration needs certificates as well
            as etcd reference which we can give for alread deployed
            kubernetes cluster.
        end note

        "K8sLCM" -> "Kuberentes API": Create storage class to HPE 3PAR persistent volume
   end
end
