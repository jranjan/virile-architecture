note over Rollie
    The below sequence talks about usage of HPE OneSphere UI to create cluster.

    Assumptions:

        We should be fine with the idea of usage of private zone page (or landscape)
        to create cluster. Note that it is different from what is being done for
        kuberentes cluster on virtualized environment. But it is the path we have
        choosen because of various reason and hence Rollie is supposed to
        exercise cluster creation in case of baremetal instead of Ed/Carla in
        case of virtualized environment.

    Pre-requisite:

         1) ConnectApp has on-boarded and authorized servers
         2) ConnectApp has creatd pseudo zone representing kubernetes cluster.
         2) New NCS API is defined for cluster creation.

    Pros:

         1) Not dependent on PF9 UI
         2) User intutive way to support cluster operations like delete, update and upgrade.
            It is sort of an alternative to what PF9 UI provides.

    Cons:

        1) New NCS API needs to be developed to create cluster
        2) Might need UX team alignment.
        3) Extra UI work for HPE OneSphere side.

K8sLCM -> "PF9 API": Create cluster

note over Rollie
    to be continued...

    After this kuberentes LCM comes into picture and does set of activities
    like deploying marketplace agent, creating storage class etc which is
    same irrespective of mode Rollie choose to create cluster. See follow-up
    of completing post-cluster creation steps in separate sequence diagram.
