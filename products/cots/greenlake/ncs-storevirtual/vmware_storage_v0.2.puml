"system"->"hellfire-ism": Create VSA cluster
note left
    This diagram captures interaction of storage aspect for
    NCS VMware stack. It includes following aspects:
        - VSA deployment
        - creation of storage cluster
        - creation of VSA volumes (count and size)
        - presneting volume to ESXi hosts
        - creation of VMDK datastore

    It does not cover flex up/down aspect of VSA cluster (will
    be addressed separately). The content is based on some
    assumptions detailed below.

    Disclaimer:

    The diagram is drawn with a understanding that Management VM
    (aka MVM) of Hellfire will act like an LCM which will provide
    following components: API, ILM and ISM. The workflow will
    exercise (via some path)  ISM code to invoke storage cluster
    creation and configuration steps. So, the system (shown as
    actor) is just a represenation of invoker here.

group Activate storage cluster using Hellfire as system
   note right
    At this point of invocation of cluster creation
    workflow, it is assume that the following
    pre-requisites are fullfilled:

        1. vsa-lcm is up and running
        2. vsa-lcm can access hellfire-ism and its
           dependent components.
        3. vCenter cluster is created (dependency on
           compute activation)
        4. iSCSI network is created and all ESXi hosts
           are connected to iSCSI network (dependency
           on underlay network creation)
        5. All ESXi hosts are accessible using LCM
           (management) network for all vsa cluster
           oepration(s).
